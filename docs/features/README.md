## Adding New Feature Docs

1. Copy `_template.md` to a new file named after the feature
2. Fill in all sections
3. Add entry to the index table above

## When to Document

Create feature documentation when:
- Implementing complex algorithms
- Integrating external APIs
- Building features that span multiple components
- Making non-obvious architectural decisions

Keep docs focused on the "how" and "why" - code comments handle the "what".
