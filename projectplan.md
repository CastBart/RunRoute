## Technology Stack - Spec vs. Actual

| Component | Specification | Current Implementation | Action Required |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Framework | React Native + Expo | ✅ React Native + Expo | None |
| State Management | Redux Toolkit + RTK Query | ⚠️ Zustand + React Query | Consider migration or keep Zustand |
| Navigation | React Navigation v6 | ✅ React Navigation v7 | None (newer version) |
| Maps | react-native-maps | ✅ react-native-maps | None |
| Location | expo-location | ✅ expo-location | None |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL | ✅ Supabase client setup | Schema needs creation |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | ✅ Implemented | None |
| Storage | AsyncStorage | ✅ AsyncStorage | None |

**Note on State Management:** The specification documents call for Redux Toolkit, but the current implementation uses Zustand + React Query, which is a modern, lightweight alternative with ~90% less boilerplate. Decision needed: migrate to Redux (as per spec) or continue with Zustand (simpler, modern approach).

### Phase 9: Advanced Features & Polish ⬜ TODO

**Priority:** LOW - Post-MVP

#### Route Enhancements
- [ ] Save planned routes
- [ ] Route library/favorites
- [ ] Share routes with other users
- [ ] Route recommendations based on distance/location
- [ ] Elevation profile preview
- [ ] Weather integration

#### Tracking Enhancements
- [ ] Audio coaching (pace alerts)
- [ ] Interval training mode
- [ ] Race mode with virtual pacing
- [ ] Apple Health / Google Fit integration
- [ ] Smartwatch companion app

#### Social Enhancements
- [ ] Activity feed on home screen
- [ ] Achievements/badges system
- [ ] Challenges with friends
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Running groups/clubs

#### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Offline mode for GPS tracking
- [ ] Route caching for offline use
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Crash reporting setup

---

### Phase 10: State Management Migration (OPTIONAL) ⬜ DECISION NEEDED

**Current Status:** Using Zustand + React Query (modern, lightweight)
**Spec Requirement:** Redux Toolkit + RTK Query

#### If Migration Decided:
- [ ] Install Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
- [ ] Create Redux store configuration
- [ ] Migrate auth store from Zustand to Redux slice
- [ ] Migrate route store from Zustand to Redux slice
- [ ] Migrate tracking store from Zustand to Redux slice
- [ ] Set up RTK Query API endpoints
- [ ] Update all components using stores
- [ ] Migrate persistence from Zustand persist to Redux Persist
- [ ] Test all state management functionality
- [ ] Remove Zustand dependencies

**Recommendation:** Keep Zustand + React Query. It's simpler, has less boilerplate, excellent TypeScript support, and is widely adopted. Migration would add significant complexity without clear benefits.

---

## Critical Issues & Action Items

### 🔴 High Priority

1. **Google Maps API Key Security**
   - **Issue:** API key is hardcoded in `app.json`
   - **Action:** Move to environment variables and regenerate key
   - **File:** `app.json` line with `googleMapsApiKey`

2. **Database Schema Creation**
   - **Issue:** Database tables don't exist yet
   - **Action:** Execute SQL scripts in Supabase dashboard
   - **Blocking:** Run tracking, history, and social features

3. **API Endpoints**
   - **Issue:** Only auth endpoints work currently
   - **Action:** Implement RPC functions and queries as per API spec
   - **Reference:** `spec/4. API Specification Document/runroute_api_specification.md`

### 🟡 Medium Priority

1. **State Management Decision**
   - **Issue:** Using Zustand instead of spec'd Redux
   - **Action:** Decide to keep Zustand or migrate to Redux
   - **Impact:** Low if staying with Zustand, high effort if migrating

2. **Type Definitions**
   - **Issue:** Types defined but may need sync with actual DB schema
   - **Action:** Review and update `src/types/index.ts` after DB creation

3. **Error Handling**
   - **Issue:** Basic error handling exists but not comprehensive
   - **Action:** Add proper error boundaries and user-friendly messages

### 🟢 Low Priority

1. **Testing**
   - **Issue:** No tests written yet
   - **Action:** Add unit tests for utilities and integration tests for flows

2. **Documentation**
   - **Issue:** Limited code documentation
   - **Action:** Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
